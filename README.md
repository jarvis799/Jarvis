# JARVIS Voice Assistant

An Android voice assistant built with Kotlin, Gemini Live, on-device voice components, accessibility automation, screen capture, and a native Android UI.

## Project status

- Android application module: `app`
- Application ID: `com.jarvis.assistant`
- Minimum Android version: Android 8.0 (API 26)
- Compile and target SDK: 34
- Java/Kotlin target: 17
- Current app version: 1.8.7 (version code 143)

## Getting started

1. Open the project root in Android Studio and allow Gradle to sync.
2. Set the Android SDK path in your local `local.properties` file. The file is machine-specific and is ignored by Git.
3. Launch the app on an Android 8.0+ device or emulator.
4. Add a Gemini API key in the app's Settings and grant the requested runtime permissions.

The Gradle wrapper is included in this project. Use `gradlew.bat` on Windows or `./gradlew` on macOS/Linux.

## Build commands

```powershell
# Windows: compile and package a debug APK
.\gradlew.bat :app:assembleDebug

# Windows: compile and package a release APK
.\gradlew.bat :app:assembleRelease
```

```bash
# macOS/Linux
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug
./gradlew :app:assembleRelease
```

Build outputs are written under `app/build/outputs/` and are generated files, not source files. Release builds enable R8 and resource shrinking. `assembleRelease` intentionally refuses to package unless a dedicated keystore, its SHA-256 certificate pin, and publisher metadata are configured. Never commit keystores or passwords.

Create and protect a release key outside this repository, then supply these values only in the local shell or Gradle user properties:

```powershell
$env:JARVIS_RELEASE_STORE_FILE = 'C:\secure\jarvis-release.jks'
$env:JARVIS_RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD = '<local secret>'
$env:JARVIS_RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS = 'jarvis-release'
$env:JARVIS_RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD = '<local secret>'
$env:JARVIS_RELEASE_CERT_SHA256 = '<64 hex characters from keytool -list -v>'
$env:JARVIS_DEVELOPER_NAME = 'AHONA'
$env:JARVIS_COPYRIGHT_OWNER = 'AHONA'
.\gradlew.bat :app:assembleRelease
```

The certificate fingerprint must be calculated from the same key used to sign the APK. This project currently has no deployed verification backend or agreed verification API protocol. Local signer pinning and APK signatures do not provide server-side authentication, Play Integrity attestation, or rate limiting; the app identity screen reports remote verification as unavailable until that service is implemented and deployed.

## Building the APK with GitHub Actions

The workflow `.github/workflows/android-apk.yml` builds the debug APK automatically: on every push to `main`, on pull requests that target `main`, and manually from the Actions tab.

1. **Open the Actions tab** — On the repository page, click the **Actions** tab.
2. **Select the workflow** — In the left sidebar, choose **DEV STYLE — JARVIS Android APK**.
3. **Run it manually** — Click **Run workflow**, keep the branch set to `main`, and press **Run workflow**.
4. **View build logs** — Open a workflow run and click the **Build debug APK** job; each step (checkout, JDK 17, Android SDK, Gradle build, APK verification) shows its own log.
5. **Download the APK** — After a successful run, scroll to the run's **Artifacts** section and download **DEV-STYLE-Jarvis-debug-apk** (retained for 14 days), then unzip it to get the APK.
6. **Debug vs release APK** — The artifact is a **debug** APK, signed with the standard debug keystore: fine for testing and side-loading, but **not** a production-signed release. A properly signed release APK needs the release keystore and its SHA-256 certificate pin configured as secrets (see *Build commands* above). Those are secret credentials that are never committed, so this workflow intentionally builds and uploads only the debug APK.

## Documentation

- [Documentation index](docs/README.md)
- [Voice architecture research](docs/architecture/voice-architecture-research.md)
- [Voice issue recordings](docs/diagnostics/voice-videos/README.md)

## Configuration and privacy

- Keep API keys, SDK paths, signing keys, and local machine settings out of source control.
- `local.properties` is local-only; start from `local.properties.example` when setting up a new machine.
- Screen sharing and accessibility automation require explicit Android user consent and permissions.
- Bundled Vosk model assets are runtime dependencies; do not remove or rename their directories without updating the model-loading code.
